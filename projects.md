## Zero-K projects

| Project     | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Brief Encounter Map      |        | Done, but ugly |
| Logistics-K      | Simple ZK variant themed around logistics       | Design done, eco-grid 80% done |
| dyth's mod      | Rebalancing and a few new heavy units       | Small bits done, some units in progress, still plenty left |
| Simplified zk      | Trimmed down version of zk       | Mostly done, need to sort out keybindings and a few other tweaks (Ronin AI, plates) |
| Silo quick menu     |        | Basic and buggy, needs rework |
| Economist AI    |        | Functional, minor improvements before push |
| Legible 1v1 AI    |        | Simple tank push done, basic design for others done |
| Legible teams AI    |        | Architecture and libraries partly done, design outline done |
| AI tweaks    | Requested AI tweaks: no-rush mode, something between Normal and Hard AI, faster finishes by both AI (AI should resign) and player (AI should get better at finishing off the player)      | idea |
| Overdrive payback    |        | Functional, some tidy up desireable |
| Map resizer     |        | Parser complete, some write issue |
| Unit spread dist toggle     | Makes units try and keep their distance from eachother to avoid AoE       | Idea |
| Unit balling     | Useful for easier shieldball and Pala control: being able to designate a group of units and select a leader, the other units will then circle the leader and get lower selection rank than it. Any other units assigned to guard the leader also join the party      | Idea |
| Imp com helper   | Widget that lets you make an imp periodically move to follow your com when nothing is in LoS, then bury so that it can trap enemy attackers | Idea|
| Snitch helper   | Widget that automatically takes care of the reserve of snitches for you, spreading them, following the Iris and changing selection priorities so there's always one available to select, slows the selectable one down at edge of Iris range to stay within cloak unless you hold control | Idea|
| Unit follow/positioning widget     | Tethers a unit to another, making it try and keep a small distance from it       | Design, needs keybinding decided |
| Area mex with turrets     |        | Functional, needs keybinding |
| Unit states: aggressive/defensive     | These states would dictate whether unit AI would try and avoid coming into range of another unit. Good for Recluse vs stinger       | Idea |
| Avoidance Unit AI     | Cloaked units avoid getting decloaked, even when attack moving. Combinable with the above unit states idea       | Functional but a bit buggy |
| Cyclops Inching      |        | Needs rework |
| Gnat smart targetting | Makes gnats and other stunners spread out to stun other targets if current target would be permastunned by current amount of gnats | Idea |
| Funnelweb rework    |        | Several ideas, none approved yet |
| Teleporter/portal superweapon | | Concept still blurry |
| One-click iris making | | Idea |
| Army size overlay | | Idea |
| Alternative elo systems | Each mod getting its own ELO that is used for balancing, mods could specify whether they also include base ZK games for balancing | idea |
| Website API | e.g battles, maps, players | idea |
| New Funnelweb    |        | Done |
| Bomber reload UI    |        | Done, finished by sprunk |
| Shield damage display UI    |        | Done |
| Wreck hitboxes improvements   |        | Done |
| Auto assist/reclaim/heal widget   |        | Done |
| Starlight laser targetting   |        | Done, finished by GoogleFrog |
| Anti-bait   |        | Done |
